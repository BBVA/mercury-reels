    "## What is Event Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "In `reels`, event optimization refers to the process of refining how raw event codes are represented before model training. Real-world datasets often contain thousands of distinct event codes, many of which are sparse, redundant, or weakly informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event optimization reduces this high-cardinality space by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limiting the maximum number of discovered events\n",
    "* Selecting the most informative codes\n",
    "* Aggregating or pruning infrequent events\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a more compact and balanced event representation, which can improve model stability, interpretability, and predictive performance while reducing noise introduced by rare or random codes.\n"

    "## The problem Event Optimization solves!\n",
    "\n",
    "Real datasets possibly have hundreds of millions of transactions, millions of clients and thousands of event codes. Reels usually works just fine in those conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, there may be additional complications:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Sequences for each client are typically very long (over 100 events).\n",
    "  - We want to predict a target that is extremely unbalanced, like in fraud applications where only 1 in 10,000 clients are targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the data will result in way too many sequences being seen just once in the dataset. That will result in extreme overfitting to the point that the model will be of very limited use when applied to unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the \"magical solution\" to that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In these conditions, we will typically fit the model with the `as_states` argument of `Targets.fit()` set to true. If, rather than having 30,000 event codes, we could \n",
    "\"magically\" select the 20 codes that are relevant to predicting the target and assign a dummy code to all the rest, we would benefit from both:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The sequences becoming much shorter (as states)\n",
    "  - The sequences being much less unique\n",
    "  \n",
    "That produces a much smaller tree with many more visits per node that will generalize much better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the \"practical solution\" to that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, it is hard to \"magically\" find **the 20** codes. When we limit the discovery of codes by setting the `max_num_events` argument when constructing `Events` objects, we are only limiting the event to the most **frequently seen** in the dataset, **not necessarily relevant** to any prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is: we may find a set of 200 codes that includes 15 of them that works almost as well as the \"perfect\" fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can do that, if we are lucky, by calling an automatic search with default parameters. More likely, it will happen using the tools the **event optimizer** provides to better understand the problem and manually including and excluding sets of codes from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The quest for \"The Dictionary\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing, we want to find a dictionary that maps thousands of codes in an **Events** object into tens of relevant codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples to understand how to discover and apply that dictionary."

    "This synthetic dataset is smaller, simpler and much less unbalanced than the original one. Therefore, it works much better \"out of the box\". Nonetheless, it does improve somewhat with event optimization and, because it is not so easy to auto detect the signal, provides a good basis to understand manual intervention on the optimization algorithm."

    "## Results Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between the baseline configuration and the optimized event configuration shows clear structural and performance differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When event discovery is unrestricted, the model builds a larger and more fragmented tree. Many nodes are supported by very few visits, which leads to sparsity and less reliable estimates. This is reflected in a more unbalanced structure and weaker generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying event optimization (e.g., limiting the number of discovered codes), the event space becomes more compact. The resulting tree is smaller, with more balanced node visits and stronger statistical support per split. Performance metrics improve or become more stable across cross-validation folds, indicating better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, these results show that reducing event cardinality does not simply shrink the model — it restructures it. The optimized configuration concentrates signal into fewer, more informative event codes, leading to a cleaner model structure and more reliable predictions.\n"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should understand that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Event representation strongly influences model behavior.** The way raw codes are defined and limited directly affects tree structure, sparsity, and predictive stability.\n",
    "* **High-cardinality event spaces can hurt generalization.** Too many rare or weakly supported codes lead to fragmented trees and unreliable estimates.\n",
    "* **Event optimization is a structural decision, not just a tuning trick.** Limiting or selecting events reshapes the model and concentrates signal into more informative splits.\n",
    "* **Simpler event spaces can improve both interpretability and performance.** A more compact representation often yields more balanced nodes and more stable cross-validated results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main lesson is that thoughtful event design is a core part of modeling with `reels`, not a secondary refinement step.\n"
