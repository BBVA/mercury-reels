Reels identifies events by assigning them **event codes** and creates **clips**, which are sequences of codes and times for each client. Using these clips, a model can be generated to predict the time at which similar events may occur in the future, based on new data.\n",

    "### Zooming into the prediction details \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental ideas that we have to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We only have the \"time to target\" for the targets\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obvious, but still important to bear in mind. In survival analysis when we observe failures of lightbulbs, the lightbulbs that do not fail during our study are **not expected to work forever**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Poisson distribution** expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring with a known constant mean rate. Our predictions will assign time estimates to the **non targets** according to this principle, because it is the simplest possible assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This translates into: If we had 40% of targets happening 1 hour after the sequence, the non targets would have a prediction time accordingly longer than one hour, but shorter than if the same targets would have been 4% instead of 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Targets vs. non targets\" is a binomial proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe 3 targets out of 7, we have much less evidence than if we observe 300 out of 700 even if the maximum likelihood estimate (3/7) is the same in both cases. A better estimate, if we consider that the target is a risk, would be an upper confidence bound for the binomial proportion.
